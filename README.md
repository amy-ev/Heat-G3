# Heat-G3
### COMP8860
This project involved adding accessibility features to the HEAT IDE software to make it more accessible for people withsevere visual impairments. To achieve this goal we successfully implemented new features to the GUI, including:
- GUI font resizing,
- new icons,
- a visual disturbance filter,
- syntax highlighting options for colorblindness,
- audio responses for compile status,
- and an extended setting screen.

In order to facilitate an efficient development process, we decided to organise our approach to the project around an Agile methodology, specifically Scrum.
